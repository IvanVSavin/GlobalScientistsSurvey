# GlobalScientistsSurvey
This repository contains data and code of a global survey of scientists on climate policy conducted by myself, Stefan Drews and Jeroen van den Bergh.

Please replace the working directory in the R code for computer to find the data, and make sure all the necessary R libraries are installed.

If you want to reproduce results of topic modelling using the survey, use the R file with STM in its title.
